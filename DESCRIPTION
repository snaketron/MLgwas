Description: Tool for genome-wide association for studying multiple 
    traits of inbred mice. Using Bayesian multi-level models and 
    statistical learning techniques, MouseGwas extracts as much 
    information from the genotype-phenotype data as possible, and 
    summarizes the association strengths using intuitive metrics.
